n=10 and m=12
next n integer are no corona cases in ith locality
next m line contain 3 integer intial_node, final_node, traveling cost
next line contain starting and ending point

We have to calculate the minimume danger path from 7 to 3 which they travelled at minimum cost 
OUPUPT is:
minimum danger=5
minimum cost=60
path travel: 7->8->5->3
